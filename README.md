# camo-worm-optimisation
Application of a meta-heuristic algorithm to optimise the definition of OCT scan images.

### Packages Required

<p>In order to run the main program, run.py, you will need to install the following 3 packages before you can run it. (If you dont install these you will get an error).</p>
<p>These packages are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>numpy</li>
    <li>matplotlib</li>
    <li>sklearn</li>
</ul>

### Running the PSO for Camo Worm Optimisation
Clone this repo to your own desktop by 
```git clone https://github.com/pproe/camo-worm-optimisation.git```

And run 
```python run.py``

Images will be generaed at each iteration to present the particle exploration and evolution. They are saved under ```gbest_imgs```. A line plot that records the cost of gbest will be generated under ```particle_explore```
